                Dr Yunus emphasised the interim government's dedication to restoring
                democracy, combating corruption, and overhauling key sectors such as
                the judiciary, banking, and education. That’s precisely what version
                2 means. We don't want to go back to the old style. Then what is the
                meaning of giving all these lives? It has no meaning because
                everything that we did, we destroyed everything. So we have to begin
                to build a new one.
